# Authentication

- Take me to the [Video Tutorial](https://kodekloud.com/topic/authentication-2/)

In this section we will take a look at `Authentication`.

  - There are different authentication mechanisms that can be configured.  You can have a list of username and passwords in a static password file, or usernames and tokens in a static token file, or you can authenticate using certificates. And another option is to connect to third party authentication protocols like LDAP, Kerberos etc.
