# Lab - AppArmor

  - Take me to the [Lab](https://kodekloud.com/topic/lab-apparmor-2/)

Solutions Lab - AppArmor:

- AppArmor is in beta **`beta`** state as of version 1.20.

- Is the AppArmor module loaded in node01?
  <details>

  ```
  Run
  $ ssh node01
  $ aa-status
  ```
  </details>

- How many AppArmor profiles have been loaded in total currently?
  <details>
  
  ```
  Run
  $ ssh node01
  $ aa-status
    
  52
  ```
  </details>

- How many AppArmor profiles have been loaded in enforce mode currently?
  <details>
  
  ```
  Run
  $ ssh node01
  $ aa-status

  15
  ```
  </details>

- A pod called nginx has been deployed in the default namespace.
What is the status of this pod?
  <details>
  
  ```
  Run
  Exit from node01 using
  $ exit
  Then get the pods using and examine the status
  $ kubectl get pods
  Blocked
  ```
  </details>

- Why is this pod in a blocked state?
  <details>
  
  ```
  Inspect the error message for this pod by running
  $ kubectl describe pod nginx
  AppArmor profile not loaded
  ```
  </details>

- What is the name of the AppArmor profile used by this pod?
  <details>
  
  ```
  Inspect the failure message for this pod by running
  $ kubectl describe pod nginx
  Custom nginx
  ```
  </details>

- Load the AppArmor profile called custom-nginx on node01 and make sure that it is in enforced mode.
The profile file is called usr.sbin.nginx located in the default AppArmor profiles directory.
  <details>
  
  ```
  $ ssh node01
  $ apparmor_parser -q /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.nginx
  Custom nginx
  ```
  </details>

- Recreate the nginx pod. The pod definition file is created at `/root/CKS/custom-nginx.yaml`.
  <details>
  
  ```
  $ exit
  $ kubectl apply -f /root/CKS/custom-nginx.yaml
  ```
  </details>

- Which tabs are you able to access?
  <details>

  ```
  Public and restricted site
  ```
  </details>

- Let's fix that. Another profile is created at `/etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.nginx-updated` which prevents reads on the restricted directory inside the container.
Use this AppArmor profile and recreate this container.
  <details>
  
  ```
  make sure restricted-nginx is loaded by running
  $ ssh node01
  $ aa-status
  Run it using
  $ apparmor_parser -q /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.nginx-updated
  Validate that it is running using
  $ aa-status
  Update the pod YAML file's annotation with the restricted-nginx apparmor profile and then recreate the pod.
  ```
