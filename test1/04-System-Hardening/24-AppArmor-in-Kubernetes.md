# AppArmor in Kubernetes

  - Take me to the [Video Tutorial](https://kodekloud.com/topic/apparmor-in-kubernetes/)

In this section, we will take a look at `AppArmor in Kubernetes`.

- Kubernetes version is at least v1.4 -- Kubernetes support for AppArmor was added in v1.4. Kubernetes components older than v1.4 are not aware of the new AppArmor annotations and will silently ignore any AppArmor settings that are provided.
