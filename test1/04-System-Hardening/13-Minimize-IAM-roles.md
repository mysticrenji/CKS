# Minimize IAM Roles

  - Take me to [Video Tutorial](https://kodekloud.com/topic/minimize-iam-roles/)

In this section, we will take a look at `Minimize IAM Roles`.

  - As a standard when a user is just created, Cloud Providers assign the least privilege permission to the user.

  - When you first create an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account, you begin with a single sign-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account. This identity is called the **`AWS account root user`** and is accessed by signing in with the email address and password that you used to create the account.

  - An IAM Group is a collection of users which allows us to specify permissions to multiple users at once.
